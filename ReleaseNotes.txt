Summary of release 2.1.0.1 changes (Fri Dec 22 2023) -
    - Support configurable digest algorithms (one of sha256, sha384, sha512) for digest-challenge between publisher (‘jald’) and subscribers (‘jal_subscribe’, ‘jnl_test’). Until this point, only sha256 was supported. Note that Java 8 does not support sha384 hash algorithm.
    - Added configurable buffer size for reading/downloading J/A/L record payloads.

Summary of release 2.1.0.0 changes (Thu Dec 15 2022) -
    - Added Java 11 support (besides Java 8).
        -- The default Java target version in jnl_parent/pom.xml is 1.8.
        -- Use "mvn -Djava.version=11 -U clean package" for Java 11 build, or update jnl_parent/pom.xml before the build. 
    - Tested JJNL subscriber on RHEL 8.
    - Added support for trustStore. Until this point, all the private and remote certs/keys were stored in a single keyStore. Note that the single keyStore sill works just as before when the trustStore related settings are excluded in the JSON config file.
    - Added "jalop-v2-tls.pdf" document with instructions on creating TLS certificates, keyStore, and trustStore.
    - Added the ability to pass in a Logger implementation to JJNL. This facilitates conveying JJNL log messages (errors/warnings/debug based on log level) to the NiFi bulletin board.
    - Allow multiple instances of the JJNL subscriber (jnl_test) from within the same JVM (e.g. a NiFi processor).

Summary of release 2.0.0.0-final changes (Sat Jul 10 2021) -
    - Added parentheses to each print statement to be compatible with python 3.
    - Copied data files from "jalop" repository to "jjnl" repository for the unit tests. Updated the test data directory in unit test code.
    - Set Content-Type HTTP header to "application/http+jalop" on response messages.
    - Wrote a new method to print HttpServletResponse headers.
    - Subscriber temp record storage is cleared out when a journal resume record is being sent and another journal record is sent. Changed so that only the initial journal resume record is treated as a journal resume record. So if another separate journal record is sent while journal resume record is in progress it is now correctly treated as a normal journal record.
