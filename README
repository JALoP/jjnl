This is Java JALoP Network Library (JJNL) v1.x.

JJNL v1.x implements a library that supports sending and receiving of
JALoP Records over a network using the JALoP over BEEP protocol. Simply put,
JJNL v1.x is a JALoP v1.x (JALoP over BEEP) Publisher and Subscriber.

Building and Installing:

This project uses the maven (maven.apache.org) build tool version 3.2.1, and 
is tested using the Oracle Java SE Development Kit 7u51. Other versions of
the JDK/JVM and maven should work, but have not been tested.

The JJNL uses a multi-module layout, and the entire project can be built by
running maven commands in the jnl_parent directory. The various modules are:

 - jnl_parent - This is the top-level project. Running maven commands within
      this directory affects all modules in the project. The jnl_parent module
      contains common configuration and dependency information.

 - jnl_lib - This module contains the code for the Java JALoP Network Library.

 - jnl_test - This module contains a utility program that acts as a JALoP Network
      Store. It uses the JNL to either listen for incoming connections, or
      initiate a connection to a remote. It's behaviour is governed by a
      configuration file.  The path to the configuration file is passed as a
      command line argument.

Installation Instructions:

1. Install maven:
    % yum install maven

2. Install the target beepcore library
    # Go to the root jjnl directory and run the following commands to determine the required beepcore version:
        ver=$(gawk 'BEGIN{RS="<[^>]+>"}{if (RT=="</beepcore.version>"){print $1}}' jnl_parent/pom.xml)
        echo $ver

    # Install beepcore from the jjnl 3rd-party distribution directory
        cd 3rd-party/beepcore-java/${ver}
	gunzip beepcore-${ver}.tgz
        tar xvf beepcore-${ver}.tar
        cd beepcore-${ver}/lib
        chmod 744 ./install_jars.sh
        ./install_jars.sh
     
3. Package JALoP JNL project
	# Go to the root directory for the jjnl repository. 
	# Go into the jnl_parent subdirectory:
        cd ../../../../../jnl_parent

	# Build the jjnl library using maven:
		mvn clean
		mvn package

	# Note:
	# On Solaris use the following option when building under Java 7 due to JMockit / Java 7 configuration issues.
		mvn package -DskipTests=true

Other Options:
--------------
These steps do not need to be executed in order to use the JALoP
libraries.

To run the unit tests and generate code coverage reports, run:
	mvn test

The generated code coverage reports will appear in the directory coverage-report

To clean the target directory, run:
	mvn clean

To generate Javadoc documentation, run:
	mvn site

The generated documents will appear in the directory target/site.

This project is built and tested in the following environments:
  RHEL 6 on x86_64
  RHEL 7 on x86_64
