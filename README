This is an implementation of a library that supports sending and receiving of
JALoP Records over a network using the JALoP/BEEP protocol.

Building and Installing
This project uses the maven (maven.apache.org) build tool version 3.0.4, and 
is tested using the Oracle Java SE Development Kit 6u27. Other versions of
the JDK/JVM and maven should work, but have not been tested.

Installation Instructions:

1. Download and install maven
	(Follow instructions at http://maven.apache.org/download.html)

2. Download the beepcore package from the JALoP Area on github, it is available
  here: https://github.com/downloads/jalop-tresys/beepcore-java/beepcore-0.9.09.tgz

3. Extract the beepcore tarball to $HOME/jalop-3rdparty (note that the JJNL build 
   expects to find the beepcore jars at this location). If you want to extract the
   binaries somewhere else, you will need to either pass this location on the command
   line to Maven, or change the property in the top-level POM. To set things on the
   command line do:
   mvn -Dthird.party.root=/path/to/3rdparty 
   Note that you will need to do this every time you run maven. Alternatively, you could
   modify the pom.xml file in this directory, and replace the value of third.party.root
   with an absolute path to where you extracted the beepcore files.

3. Package JALoP JNL project
	- Run mvn package

Other Options (these steps do not need to be executed in order to use the JALoP
libraries)
To run the unit tests and generate code coverage reports, run
$ mvn test
The generated code coverage reports will appear in the directory coverage-report

To clean the target directory, run
$ mvn clean

To generate Javadoc documentation, run
$ mvn site
The generated documents will appear in the directory target/site


All of the source code for the implementation is under the 'src' directory.
