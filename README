This is an implementation of a library that supports sending and receiving of
JALoP Records over a network using the JALoP/BEEP protocol.

Building and Installing
This project uses the maven (maven.apache.org) build tool version 3.2.1, and 
is tested using the Oracle Java SE Development Kit 7u51. Other versions of
the JDK/JVM and maven should work, but have not been tested.

The JJNL uses a multi-module layout, and the entire project can be built by
running maven commands in the jnl_parent directory. The various modules are:

 - jnl_parent - This is the top-level project. Running maven commands within
      this directory affects all modules in the project. The jnl_parent module
      contains common configuration and dependency information.

 - jnl_lib - This module contains the code for the Java JALoP Network Library.

 - jnl_test - This module contains a utility program that acts as a JALoP Network
      Store. It uses the JNL to either listen for incoming connections, or
      initiate a connection to a remote. It's behaviour is governed by a
      configuration file.  The path to the configuration file is passed as a
      command line argument.

Installation Instructions:

1. Download and install maven:
	(Follow instructions at http://maven.apache.org/download.html)

2. Install the target beepcore library
    # Go to the root jjnl directory and run the following commands to determine the required beepcore version:
        ver=$(gawk 'BEGIN{RS="<[^>]+>"}{if (RT=="</beepcore.version>"){print $1}}' jnl_parent/pom.xml)
        echo $ver

    # Install beepcore from the jjnl 3rd-party distribution directory
        cd 3rd-party/beepcore-java/${ver}
	gunzip beepcore-${ver}.tgz
        tar xvf beepcore-${ver}.tar
        cd beepcore-${ver}/lib
        chmod 744 ./install_jars.sh
        ./install_jars.sh
     
3. Package JALoP JNL project
	# Go to the root directory for the jjnl repository. 
	# Go into the jnl_parent subdirectory:
        cd ../../../../../jnl_parent

	# Build the jjnl library using maven:
		mvn clean
		mvn package

	# Note:
	# On Solaris use the following option when building under Java 7 due to JMockit / Java 7 configuration issues.
		mvn package -DskipTests=true

Other Options:
--------------
These steps do not need to be executed in order to use the JALoP
libraries.

To run the unit tests and generate code coverage reports, run:
	mvn test

The generated code coverage reports will appear in the directory coverage-report

To clean the target directory, run:
	mvn clean

To generate Javadoc documentation, run:
	mvn site

The generated documents will appear in the directory target/site.
